# Set the default CPU scaling governor at boot time. Some possible choices are:  #
# performance:  The CPUfreq governor "performance" sets the CPU statically       #
#               to the highest frequency within the borders of scaling_min_freq  #
#               and scaling_max_freq.                                            #
# powersave:    The CPUfreq governor "powersave" sets the CPU statically to the  #
#               lowest frequency within the borders of scaling_min_freq and      #
#               scaling_max_freq.                                                #
# userspace:    The CPUfreq governor "userspace" allows the user, or any         #
#               userspace program running with UID "root", to set the CPU to a   #
#               specific frequency by making a sysfs file "scaling_setspeed"     #
#               available in the CPU-device directory.                           #
# ondemand:     The CPUfreq governor "ondemand" sets the CPU depending on the    #
#               current usage.                                                   #
# conservative: The CPUfreq governor "conservative", much like the "ondemand"    #
#               governor, sets the CPU depending on the current usage. It        #
#               differs in behaviour in that it gracefully increases and         #
#               decreases the CPU speed rather than jumping to max speed the     #
#               moment there is any load on the CPU.                             #
# schedutil:    The CPUfreq governor "schedutil" aims at better integration with #
#               the Linux kernel scheduler. Load estimation is achieved through  #
#               the scheduler's Per-Entity Load Tracking (PELT) mechanism, which #
#               also provides information about the recent load.                 #
