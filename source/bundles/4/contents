# Services that should be started at runlevel 4.                     #
# You can add your own services here if you want to include them in  #
# this runlevel.                                                     #
# You can also disable some of the services here by commenting       #
# them out. Note that if you disable a service that is a dependency  #
# of other services, it will still be started automatically by s6-rc #
# to satisfy the dependency chain.                                   #

# Runlevel 4 is basically runlevel 3 plus a display manager so we will
