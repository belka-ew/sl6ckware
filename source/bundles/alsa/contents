# Uncomment below to load the ALSA OSS kernel modules to support OSS
# applications. Unless you know that something requires OSS support, it
# is better to leave it disabled. Some applications will try OSS first
# even though they also support ALSA, and will block other applications
# from using audio I/O.
#
# Many programs that use OSS can be run using the aoss wrapper and will
# then use ALSA in a non-blocking way (and will not require loading
# these kernel modules). Consider trying that before enabling these
# modules. (See "man aoss")
