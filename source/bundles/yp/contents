# Start NIS (Network Information Service). NIS provides network-wide
# distribution of hostname, username, and other information databases.
# After configuring NIS, you will need to uncomment the parts of this
# bundle that you want to run.
#
# NOTE: for detailed information about setting up NIS, see the
# documentation in /usr/doc/yp-tools, /usr/doc/ypbind, /usr/doc/ypserv,
# and /usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs/NIS-HOWTO.

# NIS SERVER CONFIGURATION
# If you are the master server for the NIS domain, you must run ypserv
# to service clients on the domain.
#ypserv
# If you are the master server for the NIS domain, you must also run
# rpc.yppasswdd, which is the RPC server that lets users change their
# passwords.
#yppasswdd
# If you have NIS slave servers, you might also want to start up
# rpc.ypxfrd, which transfers changes in the NIS domain to slave
# servers. Alternatively, rpc.ypxfrd can be run out of inetd.
#ypxfrd

# NIS CLIENT CONFIGURATION
# If you are an NIS client, all you need to do is run ypbind.
# Your NIS server might also be a client.
ypbind
