# Services that should be started to prepare the system before       #
# going into the desired runlevel.                                   #
# You can add your own services here if you want it to be            #
# started on every runlevel.                                         #
# You can also disable some of the services here by commenting       #
# them out. Note that if you disable a service that is a dependency  #
# of other services, it will still be started automatically by s6-rc #
# to satisfy the dependency chain.                                   #
# This bundle is analogous to the rc.S script in Slackware.          #
