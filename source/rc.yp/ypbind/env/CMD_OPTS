-d -broadcast
# Note that if you use the -broadcast option here, ypbind will ignore
# your settings in /etc/yp.conf. Instead, it will send a broadcast
# across the network to request the information needed to bind to a
# specific NIS server. Therefore, you should delete that option here if
# you have /etc/yp.conf configured.
