# Services that should be started when the system is entering the    #
# multi-user mode.                                                   #
# You can add your own services here if you want it to be started on #
# every multi user runlevel (e.g. 3 and 4).                          #
# You can also disable some of the services here by commenting       #
# them out. Note that if you disable a service that is a dependency  #
# of other services, it will still be started automatically by s6-rc #
# to satisfy the dependency chain.                                   #
# This bundle is analogous to the rc.M script in Slackware.          #
