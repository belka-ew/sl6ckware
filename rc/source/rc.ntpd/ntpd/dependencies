# bind-run is actually not a dependency for ntpd as long as the "pidfile <pidfile>"
# configuration file directive is commented out in /etc/ntp.conf. When using an
# s6-based init system, pid files are generally not needed. We will leave bind-run
# here uncommented since Slackware by default configured ntpd to write its PID to
# /var/run/ntpd.pid.
